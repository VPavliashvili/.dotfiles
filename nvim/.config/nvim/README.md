# NeoVim reconfiguration

Major points are
- migrated to lazy.nvim from packer
- refactored project structure (started usage of NeoVim's builtin folder structure logic)
- integrated mason.nvim lsp installer
- vimscript fully ditched and everything rewritten to lua
- keymaps and settings improved and customized even further

my first neovim config was outdated and needed the update<br>initial commit from this point fills everything except Debuggers and every language support except lua<br>also needs to integrate mason lspconfig 'ensure installed' list<br>
